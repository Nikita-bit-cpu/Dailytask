    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")

2. Python program to find the largest among three numbers
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
number3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))

if (number1 > number2) and (number1 > number3):
    print(f"{number1} is the largest number.")
elif (number2 > number1) and (number2 > number3):
    print(f"{number2} is the largest number.")
else:
    print(f"{number3} is the largest number.")


3. Python program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
number = int(input("Enter the number: "))

if number == 0:
    print("The number is zero.")
elif number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
else:
